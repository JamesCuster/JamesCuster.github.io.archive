Tidy Tuesday is a weekly event put on by the R for Data Science online learning community. Each week they release one or more data sets to give individuals the opportunity to practice data wrangling and visualization skills. This is where I will chronicle my Tidy Tuesday endeavors. If you are more interested in in the event you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday GitHub</a> page.
