I am a lifelong Texan, which is a source of both pride and embarassment depending on the day. I am currently in the final semester of my MS in Biostatistics and Data Science at The University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, Texas.

My current research is focused on HPV infections in the general adult population of the United States, under the supervision of Dr. Stacia DeSantis and Dr. George Delclos. Previously I worked on the School Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey at the Michael and Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living, which established a childhood obesity surveillance system to monitor the prevalence of overweight/obesity in school-aged children in Texas.

I am an R enthusiast and find great enjoyment in demystifying data. I loved jigsaw puzzles as a kid (still do), and figuring out data is my adult jigsaw puzzle. 

Please excuse my current lack of content. I am in my final semester and am very busy with classes and finishing my thesis. Content is under construction.
